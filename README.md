# MobileRobotROSGazeboSimulation
This repo relate to a real robot which design in Gazebo and controlled by Gazebo and ROS plugins.

This project is related to a real Two-Wheeled Mobile Robot but at the first step, it was designed at Gazebo Environment. This project will help you explore features and tools provided by ROS (Robot Operating System). We start building the robot from the scratch, using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) and RViz to visualize it. Further, we describe the inertia and show how to simplify the URDF using XACROS. Later, motion planning algorithms, such as Obstacle Avoidance and robot_localization methods will be used to create a map in order to path planning the robot to our goal point.
Here's what you will accomplish in this tutorial:
- [x] Build your own robot from scratch
- [x] Add Lidar and IMU sensors to the Robot
- [x] Create your own map or building in Gazebo11
- [x] Work with Topics and related commands
- [x] Work with RVIZ environmnet 
- [x] Create MAP of your envirnment with Gmapping Method
- [x] Find optimal path from your robot position to goal point
I used Gazebo11, ROS Noetic version, and Ubuntu focal disterbution in this project.Three programming language was used included.
